Complex_freq.py is used to calculate the coordination environment of the complexes and their occurrence frequencies.
The output includes the coordination number of each ligand and its corresponding frequency. This data is saved in coordination_data.npz and also printed to a .out file.

Users should modify the indices (i, j, k, l) in extract_conformers.py to extract the desired complexes.
Here, c1 == c2 == c3 == c4 == refers to the number of conformers the user wishes to extract for each type.
